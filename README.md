## What is Dinamic Form?

A Windows .NET Form that pulls the user's data from Microsoft SQL Server and displays them on the flow layout panel. When you click on a data with the mouse, the background color of that data becomes blue. In addition, you have the option of multiple data selection. It also has a delete button that deletes the data you selected from the system.
